It has been a little over 2 months since the Pi Cam was set up. The Pi Cam has been running smoothly after Kelvin made some code changes back in July to stabilize the video uploading and purging cycle. We retain about 20 hours of footage on a rolling basis due to storage limitations (video files take up a lot of space). Consequently, I have less than a day to review the videos and decide on which ones to move to a separate storage location for archive and future use.

Picking out which video files to keep is not difficult. Pi is mostly still when she is on her basking platform; therefore, the Pi Cam videos can look the same for many minutes or hours. I am able to skim through footage quickly as a result, and focus my attention on the videos that have more Pi action.

Pi is far from being a boring pet turtle in my biased opinion! :) Below are some interesting and cute moments of Pi I found while reviewing the videos.

Turtles do yawn, and Pi shows how it's done in the first video below.

In the second video, Pi climbs onto her platform so that she can bask. Sometimes she misses a step and slips on the ramp.

The third video shows Pi curiously peeking over the platform. Kelvin is somewhat nearby, so Pi turns her head towards Kelvin's direction wondering what he is up to. This video is darker than the others since Pi's basking lamp had not turned on yet.

In the last video of this post, Pi is basking on her platform and staring off into space! I wonder what she is thinking? Perhaps she is bored...
