Earlier this month, I added a giant, velvety blanket to the area of the room where the Hello Kitty pillows and other plushes reside. Since Pi enjoys burying herself under the pillows, I thought a soft blanket would bring extra coziness to the space (FYI, turtles love blankets).

After setting up the blanket, I brought Pi into the room and recorded her first encounter with the blanket. At first, she seemed to be weirded out by the sight of this unknown purple thing. :)

However, after spending several minutes in the room, Pi warmed up to the blanket and started exploring and crawling all over the blanket.

The addition of the blanket was a success! Pi likes being bundled in between the folds of the blanket and still be surrounded by her favorite pillows and plushes.
