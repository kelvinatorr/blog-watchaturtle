As a first milestone by posting here on Watch a Turtle, we are pleased to share with you one of the earliest videos of Pi recorded by the Pi Cam!

We chose to share this particular video because it captures the essence of how Pi typically spends her afternoons: relaxed on her basking platform. However, if you watch towards the end of this video, you will see Pi yawning! It turns out that turtles yawn just like we do. :)

A benefit of having a recording device is the ability to go back and review the videos. This is one of the reasons why we wanted to set up the Pi Cam, because we might get a chance to observe rare moments, such as a yawning turtle.
