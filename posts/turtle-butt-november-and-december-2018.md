Happy New Year! This post will be a recap of turtle butts from the last two months of 2018.

Here is a summary of turtle butts for November and December 2018:

- 12 data points gathered (the 12 screencaps above)
- Pi curled her tail to the left majority of the time (75%)

Overall, based on the data I have gathered in the last half of 2018, Pi seems to prefer curling her tail to the left. I suspect that how Pi orients herself on the basking platform probably dictates the potential direction of her tail curl. When Pi climbs onto the platform and then moves around, I observed that she typically pivots her entire body counter-clockwise, keeping her line of vision towards the open areas of the house (living/dining room and kitchen) instead of facing the wall (back of the tank). Perhaps with counter-clockwise movement, there is a tendency to favor the left side since Pi's tail would drag along the platform and likely be pointed towards the left side already.
