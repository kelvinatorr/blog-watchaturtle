Hello! We are Tiffany and Kelvin, the human parents of Pi and masterminds behind Watch a Turtle.

The idea of Watch a Turtle originated in the spring of 2018. While observing Pi at home one day, we wondered, what does Pi do when we're not at home? Does she sleep all day? Does she do something quirky or awesome that we don't know about? Is she trying to devise a plan to escape out of her tank? We thought it would be interesting to set up a way to video record Pi, so that we can capture moments of her when we're not around.

Kelvin uses Raspberry Pi devices at his work, and he suggested to obtain a Raspberry Pi with a camera module and install a video recording software on it. After we hooked the device on Pi's tank, the Pi Cam is ready for action!

The Pi Cam inspired us to branch out and start a project to document Pi's amusingness. In the summer of 2018, we launched watchaturtle.com where we hope to share the life of Pi and our thoughts and nuances of turtle ownership with other turtle enthusiasts.
